Greetings,

This project implements the complete IEEE802.11 protocol, including PHY, MAC, and rate adaptation approaches upon GNURadio/USRP software-defined radio platform. The project integrates the existing open-source projects (See literature [2,3]) and makes them a unity that works under the latest GNURadio platform. In addition, mainstream rate adaptation approaches Minstrel and Adaptive Auto Rate Fallback (AARF) are implemented. The rate adaptation module continuously collects the data transmission status, i.e, whether acknowledgement frames are received after data transmission, and decides the next data transmission rate to be used according to such statistics. The new data rate is then being transferred to the PHY module and applied in the subsequent frame encoding and modulation.

# Installation
Please go through [[2]](https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11/) for installation and settings.

The software is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and GNU Radio Companion 3.7.11.1. To check your GNURadio version, use

    gnuradio-companion --version

# Usage
## Use one terminal and one command
Open a terminal and run
```bash
    ./wifi_exp.sh
```
You can configure the parameters in this shell script, which invokes four separate Python scripts. You can also run those four files one by one, as shown below.

## Run python scripts individually
1. Open a terminal and run
```bash
    ./ul_buffer.py
```
   This program stores the packets to be sent and those received into TX and RX buffers, respectively. ```mac_wifi.py``` continuously checks if the TX buffer is non-empty, i.e., there is packet to deliver, and stores the received packets into the RX buffer. The buffer sizes would be displayed once changed.

2. Open another terminal and run
```bash
    ./ul_traffic.py
```
   This program generates ```n``` packets every ```t``` seconds and sends them to the TX buffer in 1. For test purpose, the generated packets are ```TEST_k``` (k=1,2,3,4).
   Note: only run ```ul_traffic.py``` after the ```ul_buffer.py``` starts, as the latter is on the server side of the socket communication.

3. Open a new terminal and run
```bash
    ./phy_wifi.py
```
   This is the physical layer implementation, which is based on the hierarchical flow graph ```wifi_phy_hier.grc```. PHY sends valid received packets for MAC for further process, and takes care of the packet transmission.
   The simulated MAC address of the USRP node is decided by the node number, which can be specified using parameter ```-n```, e.g., ```./phy_wifi.py -n 1```.

4. Open a terminal and run
```bash
    ./mac_wifi.py
```
   This program simulates the MAC layer behaviors, such as Clear Channel Assessment (CCA), waiting for the ack. It will ask ```phy_wifi.py``` for node ID and delivers its packets to Node (node + 1), such as Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 ... So if you configure one USRP as Node 1 and another as Node 2, you would only receive ACK on Node 1, as all traffic on Node 2 targets Node 3. To allow bidirectional data transfer between Node 1 and Node 2, you can modify ```dest_mac``` in the source code.

# Troubleshooting
- If you see ``ImportError: No module named wifi_phy_hier`` when running ``./phy_wifi.py``, open ``example\wifi_phy_hier.grc`` in GNURadio and generate the flow graph. You should be able to see ``wifi_phy_hier.py`` is generated under ``~/.grc_gnuradio/``.
- If you see ``return _fft_swig.fft_vcc_make(fft_size, forward, window, shift, nthreads) RuntimeError: std::exception`` when running ``./phy_wifi.py``, use ``sudo ./phy_wifi.py``. (A read-only ``.gr_fftw_wisdom`` under the ``home`` folder may be the reason of using ``sudo`` command. You can simply change its permissions to get rid of the boring ``sudo`` privilege.)

- ``Python [Errno 98] Address already in use``. Kill the process that occupies the socket.
```bash
    kill -9 $(lsof -ti tcp:xxxx)
```
Where ``xxxx`` is the socket port. If the error still exists, try
```bash
    ps -fA | grep python
    kill -9 xxxx
```
where ``xxxx`` is the PID of the running python scripts.

# Tricks
Use ```tmux``` to manage multiple terminals.
